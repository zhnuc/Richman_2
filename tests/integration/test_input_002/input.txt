We rise together as our destiny unfolds
We face the darkness and our trials are yet untold
11451
Through the shadows of despair
Oh  in silence  hopes we share
213
To chase our dreams that we've declared
We glimpse  through our eyes
Yet fools  blind our sights
Can't make what they say
We'll find our way  we'll find our way

Step through  the fire
Step quick
Help me

Heads up  the wheels are spinning
Across the plains  in valleys deep
To dawn  the wheels that sing

An unending dream
Heads up  the tracks are running
Across the plains  where shadows hide
We run  we stride
In the face of fear and plight  and yet we hold our ground
In life we stand  and strive  our victory is found
And the storms we've weathered through
And we hope in the light of truth
To break free from chains  and come anew
Heads up  the wheels are spinning
Across the plains  in valleys deep
To dawn  the wheels that sing
An unending dream
Heads up  the tracks are running
Across the plains  where shadows hide
We run  we stride
Heads up  A steady rhythm
A destination that's ever near
It comes  stride to our kingdom
And see the light of day
Heads up  the wheels are singing
The whispers and secrets they'd keep
To hope  we bound
Break free  we chased our dreams  beneath the starry night
In the face of god  we rose  as one
